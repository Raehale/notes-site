                                    <li>Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management in software development.</li>
                                    <li>Git creates checkpoints as well, you can check the history and get back to the eirlier version of it. It also allows other people to join you in editing the project at the same time as you.</li>
                                    <li>git status - checks the status of the repo</li>
                                    <li>git init - initialises a repo of a folder we are currently in; we do it only once per project. Make sure you are in the correct folder before initialising a repo. If you cloned a repo from GitHub, you probably won't need to initialize it.</li>
                                    <li>git add . - adds the changes to the staging area</li>
                                    <li>git add file1.js file2..html file3.css - adds the selected files to the staging area</li>
                                    <li>git restore --staged file3.css - unstages a file / puts it back to the working directory</li>
                                    <li>git commit -m "Your message" - makes a commit of the sataged files</li>
                                    <li>git push or git push origin main - pushes the project to the GitHub repo.</li>
                                    <li>git log or git log --oneline - shows the history of the commits</li>

                                    <li>Using the terminal create files fruits.txt, songs.txt and activities.txt.</li>

                                        message and if it is “fatal: not a git repository”, it is not initialised yet and you need to run git init command.</li>
                                    <li><blockcode>git add .</blockcode> (the dot means that there are unsaved changes) - Adding the project to the staging area helps Git track your project and see changes you have made to it. To add your project to the staging area, run the
                                        git add . command. When you run this command, you will see that the U symbol automatically changes to A. This means that your files have been added to the staging area and are now being tracked by Git, waiting to be committed. </li>
                                    <li><blockcode>git commit -m "Your message here"</blockcode> - By running the git commit command, you are saving this particular stage and the changes to your project permanently in the Git repository. And although you
                                        might make few changes to the project in the future and commit them as well, this particular commit you made now will still be saved in the Git repository and can be accessed anytime. So after your project has been added to the staging
                                        area, the next thing you'll want to do is commit it by using the git commit -m “commit message" command. When you run this command, you should notice that the A symbol in the project is no longer there, and the project looks as
                                        you'd expect once again.</li>
