What is Markdown?
An easy-to-use simplified markup language that is an alternative to using HTML. Standard HTML uses tags to surround plain text to specify how that text displays. Markdown Language simplifies formatting plain text by using keyboard strokes

Markdown Syntax
Headings - Add one to six # symbols efore the text. This corresponds to h1 - h6 and will determine the hierarchy level and typeface of the text
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Styling Text
Bold - ** or __
Italic - * or _
Strikethrough - ~~
All Bold and Italic - ***
Bold with nested Italic - **bold _italic_**

\ is an escape character for when you need to go to a new line

Quoting
Blockquote text with a >
Quote code with `
Quote a block of code with ```
To close it add ``` to a new line On github this will be copyable
You need a space below the blockquote text to escape it

Links and email adresses
[Link Text](google.com)
Link text in markdown wont open in a new tab (boo) If you need to you can use HTML for a link or tell the user to right click.
On github you can use relative links to direct to other files in your repo. For example linking to the contributing file in your readme might look liek this: [contributing.md](docs/contributing.md)
Link to an email address by wrapping the email in <>


Images
Link to images by adding ! in front of the square brackets [] that will wrap the alt text and parenthases () that will wrap the image URL.
Add a docs folder with your image directory with any screenshots for the readme
open up file explorer and drag an image into the readme file and it will place the image HTML in it. 

Lists
  Make an unordered likst by preceding text with - * or +. nest lists by adding spaces in front of the list marker character
  You can create task lists by prefacing each item with a - a pace and a square brackets []. to makrk a ttask as complete use x inside the brackets. 

When writing markdown in VS Code hit ctrl + K to view what it will look like on github

Alerts
  Alerts are markdown extention based on blockquote syntax that can be used to emphasize important information. Shouldb e used conservatively

What is a readme?
  A reademe is often the first item a visitor will see when visitiing your repository.
  usually a simple plain text file with .txt or .md file type

  a readme is a good place to land and see a summary of your project and what the code does.
  This may be helpful for someone who does not read programming languages.
