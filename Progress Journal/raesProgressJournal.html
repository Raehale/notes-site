        Today, I am breaking my coding strike. I've been on vacation, and when I came back it was hard to code. Today I will become passionate again. I am working on finishing a 
        liking feature on my compliments project. I need it to sync with firebase. I am thinking of using the firebase keys for the compliment to associate them appropriately.

        Today I am feeling overwelmed but excited. I don't want to work, I want to code. I am joining a course that will review the modules (one per week). We are starting with 
        module one today. I am overwelmed with the  lack of desire I have to do the learning portion, and instead wanting to fix my broken projects. I want to fix my notes site,
        which is not displaying the content since I moved each section to separate html files and can't get them to show up on the main html file. I've been told it's not possible
        to place html files within eachother. I am thinking of using .innerhtml but I am sure it won't work. I also need to fix the lists app. I was creating a way to add numbers,
        and it would add them together, including negatives, but now that I'm separating the lists I am rethinking how I'll do that. I think I will have a separate input section for
        the numbers. I was unable to fix the liking feature on the compliments app. I could not get it to update on firebase. I also realized I could have merged the lists in firebase,
        so I might want to refactor the whole app. All and all I am pretty overwhelmed.

        Forgot to write these, but I finally remembered two weeks later! I keep going off and just building stuff with everything I'm learning. I think in the long run
        it will help cement the information I've learned. I just learned about forEach and I really wanna use it in some of the old code I have. I might. Not today though.
        Today I learn. I'm getting through the JS module five I think. It's been an uphill battle. When I finished the pumpkins purrrfect meme loader I went off on a 
        little tangent and changed it to be a place I can put images of my pets then load a random picture of a pet based on which pet I select. You can check it out 
        <a href="https://pet-pic-picker.netlify.app/">at my netlify site "Pet Pics"</a>. The issue I have run into is I don't know how to upload an image. Or, where to
        upload it too? I'm hoping react will cover this. I really don't feel ready for any back end learning, so I hope I don't have to go there to understand it. You can
        check the code out at <a href="https://github.com/Raehale/pet-pic-picker" target="_blank">my Github</a>. Overall I'm doing good, got back up from a little not
        wanting to code struggle and feeling better then ever. Also, I would like the record to show, even though I didn't always do what I was supposed to, I did code
        every day even if I didn't write about it.
