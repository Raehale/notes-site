        Today, I am breaking my coding strike. I've been on vacation, and when I came back it was hard to code. Today I will become passionate again. I am working on finishing a 
        liking feature on my compliments project. I need it to sync with firebase. I am thinking of using the firebase keys for the compliment to associate them appropriately.
